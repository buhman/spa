refactor:
    remove all the duplicated code tidbits everywhere

map:
    or make the world scroll up/down?
    haters drop powerups.
    make ai spawn area north of "map", rather than in player view

movement/physics:
    give objects mass and make them bounce on collision.

leveling:
    temporary invulnerability on level-up?
    player ship improves on level-up
        - more weapons
        - laser beams (done?)
        - mini gun / powerful machine gun
        - faster bullets
        - missle lock

graphics:
    a parallaxing 'star' background
    represet more ship types graphically
    make bullet drawing simpler
    draw player mid-warp on both sides of warp rather than jumping

ai:
    different hater behaviors for different ship types.
    haters fire at future location rather than present location
