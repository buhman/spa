map:
    possibly make world toridal?
    or make the world scroll up/down?
    haters drop powerups.

movement/physics:
    fix acceleration branch stuff?
    make rotation slightly slower?
    give objects mass and make them bounce on collision.

leveling:
    temporary invulnerability on level-up?
    make ai spawn area either the entire "map" or north of "map", rather than in player view

graphics:
    a parallaxing 'star' background
    represet more ship types graphically

ai:
    haters should selectively have following behavior
    haters should not fire all quite at the same time; offset
    different hater behaviors for different ship types.

bugs:
    multiple shots fired too quickly by haters
